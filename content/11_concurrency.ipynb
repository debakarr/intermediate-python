    "- **Processes and threads**: A program can have one or more processes and a process can have one or more threads. A process is an instance of a program while a thread is a part of a process that can execute instructions.\n",
    "- **Multiprocessing and multithreading**: Multiprocessing uses multiple cores of a CPU to execute multiple processes in parallel. Multithreading uses multiple threads within a process to perform tasks concurrently.\n",
    "- **I/O-bound and CPU-bound tasks**: I/O-bound tasks spend more time doing input/output operations than computations (network request, disk read/write, database read/write). CPU-bound tasks spend more time doing calculations than generating I/O requests (video compression, matrix multiplication, find prime number).\n",
    "- **Suitability of multithreading and multiprocessing**: Multithreading is suitable for I/O-bound tasks, and multiprocessing is suitable for CPU-bound tasks."
