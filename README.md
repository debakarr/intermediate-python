## Try from local environment

1. Make sure you have Python installed. Follow the guide in the official Python documentation on how to do it for different operating systems: [Windows](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#installation-steps), [Mac](https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html#getting-and-installing-macpython), or [Unix](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python) systems. 
2. Considering you have Git installed. Try cloning this repository: `git clone https://github.com/debakarr/intermediate-python.git`
3. I would recommend creating a `virtual environment` to install the dependencies: `python -m venv .venv`
4. Activate virtual environment: On Windows `.venv\Scripts\activate` and on Linux `source .venv/bin/activate`
5. Install all the dependencies in the virtual environment: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Run Jupyter Lab: `jupyter lab`
